# API Workshop

Add to the code in the repo to make it:

- Make the Person Item objects prettier.
- Make it so that you can click a link to take you to a more detailed page for an individual
- Make it so that you can view people other than those on the first page of results
- Add routes to the application so that you can do similar with Planets, Starships and anything else you want to play with
- Anything else cool you can think of


Next change the code to use JSON Server and a db.json file.

Add endpoints and routes to deal with adding and updating people as well as any other suitable endpoints.

Make it cooler!
